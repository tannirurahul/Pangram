# Pangram

Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma,
"every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
The best known English pangram is:
> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

The alphabet used consists of ASCII letters `a` to `z`, inclusive, and is case
insensitive. Input will not contain non-ASCII symbols.


## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest pangram_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest pangram_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`
